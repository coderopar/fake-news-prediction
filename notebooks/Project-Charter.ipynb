    "## **Project Title:** Fake News Prediction using Machine Learning  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:**  \n",
    "The spread of misinformation and fake news undermines public trust, fuels polarization, and can have serious consequences in politics, health, and society. Manual fact-checking is slow and cannot keep up with the massive volume of online content. There is a need for automated tools that can help classify news articles as fake or true.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**  \n",
    "- Build a machine learning model to classify news articles into FAKE or TRUE.  \n",
    "- Analyze linguistic and structural patterns that distinguish fake from true reporting.  \n",
    "- Establish baseline performance metrics for future improvements.  \n",
    "- Provide interpretable outputs that can support content moderation and awareness.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope:**  \n",
    "- Use a labeled dataset of fake and true news articles.  \n",
    "- Apply natural language processing (NLP) methods such as TF-IDF and Logistic Regression for a baseline model.  \n",
    "- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  \n",
    "- Focus on **text content only** (no multimedia or source metadata).  \n",
