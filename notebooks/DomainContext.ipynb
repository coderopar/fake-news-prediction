        "\n",
        "**Project Title:** Fake News Prediction using Machine Learning  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem Statement:**  \n",
        "The spread of misinformation and fake news undermines public trust, fuels polarization, and can have serious consequences in politics, health, and society. Manual fact-checking is slow and cannot keep up with the massive volume of online content. There is a need for automated tools that can help classify news articles as fake or true.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Objectives:**  \n",
        "- Build a machine learning model to classify news articles into FAKE or TRUE.  \n",
        "- Analyze linguistic and structural patterns that distinguish fake from true reporting.  \n",
        "- Establish baseline performance metrics for future improvements.  \n",
        "- Provide interpretable outputs that can support content moderation and awareness.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Scope:**  \n",
        "- Use a labeled dataset of fake and true news articles.  \n",
        "- Apply natural language processing (NLP) methods such as TF-IDF and Logistic Regression for a baseline model.  \n",
        "- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  \n",
        "- Focus on **text content only** (no multimedia or source metadata).  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Success Criteria:**  \n",
        "- Achieve at least **80% accuracy** on test data.  \n",
        "- Balanced **precision and recall** for both FAKE and TRUE classes.  \n",
        "- A reproducible pipeline that can be extended to more advanced models.  \n"

        "\n",
        "Building a Fake News Detection model involves important ethical considerations that must be acknowledged:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Bias in Data**  \n",
        "   - The dataset may reflect political, cultural, or regional biases depending on the sources chosen.  \n",
        "   - If most fake articles are from one region or political leaning, the model may unfairly generalize.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Risk of Censorship**  \n",
        "   - A model that flags content as “fake” could be misused for **silencing dissent** or limiting free speech.  \n",
        "   - It is essential to frame the system as a **support tool**, not an absolute authority.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Transparency and Accountability**  \n",
        "   - Users should understand the model’s limitations and decision boundaries.  \n",
        "   - Explanations (e.g., why an article is flagged) are important for trust.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **False Positives vs False Negatives**  \n",
        "   - **False Positives (True news flagged as Fake):** harms media credibility and public trust.  \n",
        "   - **False Negatives (Fake news missed):** allows misinformation to spread unchecked.  \n",
        "   - The trade-off between these errors must be carefully balanced.  \n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Responsible Use**  \n",
        "   - This model should be a starting point for **awareness and research**, not the final word in content moderation.  \n",
        "   - Final decisions should always involve **human oversight** to avoid misuse.  \n"
